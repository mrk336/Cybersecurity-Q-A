# Cybersecurity-Q-A

## Q1: Walk Me Through Your First 24 Hours After a Breach

When a breach hits, it’s not just a technical event—it’s a human one. Here’s how I respond, hour by hour, blending urgency with empathy, and strategy with grit.

---

### Hour 0–1: The Call

- **Verify the breach.** SOC alerts come in—now we confirm. Is it real? What systems are affected?
- **Assemble the team.** DevOps, SOC, IT, Legal, Communications everyone gets online. No silos.
- **Initial communication.** Notify executive leadership: “We’ve had a breach. More details coming soon.”
- **Start drafting public messaging.** Transparency matters. We prepare for press and stakeholder updates.
- **Mindset:** Calm urgency. No panic. Just action.

---

### Hour 2–5: Containment Mode

- **Isolate affected systems.** Shut down compromised endpoints, revoke credentials, and preserve forensic evidence.
- **Begin forensic logging.** Every move matters—this will be reviewed later.
- **Assess impact.** What data was accessed? Who’s affected? Is it PII, IP, or internal systems?
- **Team support:** Coffee flows. Pizza arrives. We’re in the trenches together.

---

### Hour 6–12: Communicate and Investigate

- **Executive briefing.** With clearer intel, we update leadership and prepare external disclosures.
- **Press strategy.** Draft statements, prep for potential press conferences, and align with legal.
- **Deep dive begins.** ELK stack analysis, lateral movement detection, malware reverse engineering.
- **Empathy check:** Customers and employees deserve honesty and care. We lead with integrity.

---

### Hour 12–24: Recovery and Reflection

- **Root cause identified.** We document everything—attack vector, timeline, affected assets.
- **SIEM/SOAR updates.** We tune detection rules to catch similar patterns in the future.
- **Cross-team debrief.** DevOps and SOC align on lessons learned and next steps.
- **Gratitude:** I thank the team. It’s been a long, intense day. Their resilience is everything.

## Q2:How would you secure a remote workforce overnight 

### Enforce Strong Authentication

Mandate MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) across all systems no exceptions using Microsoft Entra ID or AWS IAM.

Prioritize SSO (Single Sign-On) integration (Authenticator) to streamline access and reduce password fatigue.

### Disable legacy authentication protocols (e.g., basic auth, NTLM) that are vulnerable.

### Secure Endpoint Devices

Push EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) agents to all remote machines (Microsoft XDR for MS Sentinel Integration,M365 Defender, Azure Security Center).

Enforce full disk encryption (Bitlocker) and screen lock policies.

Require VPN for all internal resource access.

### Establish Zero Trust Principles

Assume breach: verify explicitly, limit access, and enforce least privilege.

Segment access based on roles, geography, and device posture.

Use conditional access policies to block risky logins or unmanaged devices.

### Rapid Patch & Update Enforcement

Force OS and software updates overnight via MDM (Mobile Device Management).

Block access from outdated or unpatched systems until compliant.

### Deploy Cloud Security Controls

Enable CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) to monitor SaaS usage and shadow IT.

Audit and restrict third-party integrations with sensitive data access.

Monitor for anomalous behavior using UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics).

### Communicate & Train

Send a clear, urgent security bulletin to all staff: what’s changing and why.

Provide a 5-minute security checklist for employees to follow before logging in.

Launch a rapid-response helpdesk channel for access issues or suspicious activity.

### Audit & Monitor

Review access logs for unusual patterns (geo anomalies, time-based spikes).

Set up real-time alerts for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or brute-force attempts.

Begin 24/7 SOC monitoring if not already in place.

### Backup & Recovery

Confirm backups are recent, encrypted, and tested.

Ensure remote users know how to report ransomware or data loss immediately.

### Executive Communication 

Brief the board and executive team with a summary of actions taken.

Prepare a contingency plan for insider threats or compromised credentials.

Begin drafting a longer-term roadmap for remote security maturity.

## Q3: If budget is cut 30% what would you secure first 

# Prioritizing Cybersecurity Under Budget Constraints

## Context

A 30% budget cut in cybersecurity demands strategic clarity. As a CISO, your role is not just technical it's fiduciary. When resources shrink, your decisions must reflect both business impact and operational resilience.

## Guiding Principles

1. Protect what matters most to the business.
2. Minimize risk exposure with precision.
3. Communicate transparently with stakeholders.
4. Preserve team morale and operational integrity.

## Step 1: Identify the Crown Jewels

Begin by mapping critical assets:

- Customer data (PII, financial records)
- Intellectual property
- Identity and access infrastructure
- Compliance-related systems

Use a business impact analysis to prioritize. Not all assets are equal focus on what’s existential.

## Step 2: Secure Identity First

Identity is your new perimeter. Prioritize:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Continuous identity monitoring

Most breaches begin with compromised credentials. If you can’t afford full-spectrum defense, secure the front door.

## Step 3: Protect Endpoints and Email

Focus on common attack vectors:

- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Phishing and email filtering
- Patch management for critical vulnerabilities

Scale back only on non-critical endpoints. Never compromise executive or privileged systems.

## Step 4: Maintain Incident Response Readiness

You may not prevent every breach, but you must be ready to respond:

- Maintain a lean incident response plan
- Preserve logging and monitoring for key systems
- Retain forensic expertise (even if contracted)

Detection and response are non-negotiable. Removing them is like disabling a smoke alarm to save power.

## Step 5: Communicate and Collaborate

Translate technical risk into business impact. Use analogies. Show what’s at stake—reputation, trust, continuity.

Engage with peers and industry groups. Share threat intelligence. When budgets shrink, collaboration becomes a force multiplier.

## Q4: Explain Ransomware to the Board in 2 Minutes

**Ransomware** is malicious software that infiltrates systems and encrypts critical data essentially digital extortion. Attackers typically gain access through phishing emails, compromised credentials, or unpatched vulnerabilities.

When ransomware hits, operations can grind to a halt. Customer data, financial records, and intellectual property may all be locked behind a paywall. The reputational damage, regulatory exposure, and financial loss can be severe.

As **CISO**, my strategy is focused on prevention and resilience:

-  Continuous patching, updates,pentesting and enforcement to prevent compromise.
-  Regular, secure backups to ensure data recovery.
-  If ransomware strikes, we wipe infected systems, preserve integrity, and restore business continuity.

Ransomware is not just a technical issue—it’s a business risk. Our cybersecurity posture protects shareholder value, customer trust, and operational resilience.

## Q5: Tell me about a time you clashed with IT 

While cybersecurity is its own function IT has different concerns and priorities mainly keeping users happy and seeing that uptime is maintained. One of the most memorable clashes I had was with our Head of IT over endpoint monitoring. I had just joined the company, and I was pushing for deeper visibility into user behavior things like USB usage, unusual logins, and shadow IT. He saw it as surveillance. I saw it as protection.

We were both passionate, and the first few meetings were tense. At one point, he said, ‘You’re treating my team like suspects.’ That hit me. I paused and said, ‘I’m not trying to catch anyone I’m trying to make sure no one gets hurt.’

That moment shifted everything. We grabbed coffee the next day, no laptops, no slides. Just two people trying to understand each other. I listened to his concerns about trust and culture. He listened to mine about risk and accountability. We ended up co-authoring a policy that balanced transparency with security—users were informed, controls were visible, and IT felt respected.

That clash taught me something powerful: behind every technical disagreement is a human story. And if you don’t take time to hear it, you’ll never build the kind of trust that makes security truly work

## Q6: What is the last scurity problem you solved for fun 

I’m constantly exploring the edges of cybersecurity not just reacting to threats, but actively seeking them out. Whether it’s dissecting vulnerabilities in EDR agents or diving into newly published CVEs, I treat each one as a puzzle waiting to be solved. I write exploit code not just for the sake of proof-of-concept, but to simulate how a real attacker might move through my infrastructure. It’s a way of stress-testing my defenses with a red team mindset thinking like an adversary to uncover blind spots.

But that’s only half the story. Once I’ve mapped out the attack paths, I flip the script and put on my blue team hat. I ask: how would I detect this? What logs would I need? How can I build controls that don’t just block attacks, but tell a story when something goes wrong? That back-and-forth between offense and defense is where I thrive it’s not just technical, it’s strategic.

I’m also fascinated by how vulnerabilities can be chained. Sometimes a flaw looks trivial on its own, but when combined with others, it can open the door to a full breach. That kind of thinking connecting the dots, anticipating escalation is a big part of how I approach risk.

You’ll find examples of this mindset in my GitHub portfolio, where I document not just code, but the reasoning behind it. It’s a space where I share what I’ve learned, what I’ve broken, and how I’ve built it back stronger.
